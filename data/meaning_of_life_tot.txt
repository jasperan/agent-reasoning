**Step 1: Detailed Exploration of Nihilism and Existentialism**

*   **Nihilism:**  Nihilistic perspectives, originating with thinkers like Friedrich Nietzsche (though he transcends simple nihilism), fundamentally deny any objective meaning in existence. From a nihilistic standpoint, the universe is indifferent to human concerns; there are no pre-ordained values, morals, or goals.  The search for meaning is therefore a futile exercise, a projection of human desire onto a meaningless void. The implications of nihilism are profound, potentially leading to despair or, paradoxically, to a radical freedom – freedom from external constraints. A key argument is that the cosmological argument for God’s existence fails because it relies on the assumption of a purposeful creator, which nihilism denies.  The core assertion is that observation of the natural world – its apparent randomness, brutality, and lack of overarching design – supports this conclusion.

*   **Existentialism:** Existentialism, most notably articulated by Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, builds upon nihilistic insights but offers a response. Existentialists agree that there is no inherent meaning given to us. However, they argue that this absence of pre-determined meaning *creates* freedom and responsibility. “Existence precedes essence,” Sartre famously stated. This means that we are born into the world without a defined purpose, and it is through our choices and actions that we forge our own essence—our own meaning. This process is fraught with anxiety and responsibility; we are condemned to be free, entirely accountable for shaping our lives. Camus’ concept of the absurd – the clash between humanity’s inherent desire for meaning and the meaningless universe – is central to existential thought. Accepting the absurd doesn’t lead to despair but to revolt – a continuous affirmation of life despite its lack of inherent purpose.


**Final Answer:**

The question “What is the meaning of life?” does not possess a singular, objectively verifiable answer. Based on a reasoned philosophical investigation, it’s evident that the concept of “meaning” is fundamentally subjective and constructed.  Nihilistic perspectives posit that life is inherently meaningless, a product of a chaotic and indifferent universe. Conversely, existentialist thought emphasizes that this absence of inherent meaning generates radical freedom and responsibility. Individuals are tasked with creating their own values, purpose, and significance through their choices and actions.  Therefore, the “meaning of life” is not something to be *discovered* but something to be *created* – a personal and constantly evolving response to the fundamental absurdity of existence.  Ultimately, the pursuit of meaning becomes itself a significant act, regardless of whether a definitive answer can be attained.
